Installation ðŸ“€
The Drosera Operator runs on Linux.

There are two core methods to obtain the Drosera Operator application:

Pre-built binaries
Docker Images
Pre-built Binaries
Each Drosera Operator release includes pre-built binaries. You can download the latest release from the Drosera Operator GitHub Releases page.

Platforms
Binaries are supported on the following platforms:

x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu: AMD/Intel 64-bit processors (most desktops, laptops, servers)
Currently, only Ubuntu 22.04 and greater is officially supported. The Drosera team will work on supporting more Linux distributions out-of-the-box in the future.

Usage
Each binary is contained in a .tar.gz archive. To use the Drosera Operator binary, follow the following steps:

Steps
Go to the Releases page and select the latest release.
Download the drosera-operator-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz binary. For example, to obtain the binary file for v1.0.0-main.1 (the latest version at the time of writing), a user can run the following commands in a linux terminal:

cd ~
curl -LO https://github.com/drosera-network/releases/releases/download/v1.0.2/drosera-operator-v1.0.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
tar -xvf drosera-operator-v1.0.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz
The "main.1" suffix indicates a pre-release.

Test the binary with ./drosera-operator --version to verify the binary is working and the version matches the expected version.
(Optional) Move the drosera-operator binary to a location in your PATH, so the drosera-operator command can be called from anywhere. For example, to copy drosera-operator from the current directory to usr/bin, run sudo cp drosera-operator /usr/bin.
Docker
We also provide Docker images for the Drosera Operator. The Docker image can be obtained by pulling from our public registry:


docker pull ghcr.io/drosera-network/drosera-operator:latest
Test the Docker image by running the following command:


docker run ghcr.io/drosera-network/drosera-operator --help
Recommended System Requirements
The Drosera Operator is a lightweight application that can run on most modern systems. However, we recommend the following system requirements for optimal performance:

2 CPU Cores
4 GB RAM
20 GB Disk Space
The more traps you are opted into, the more resources the Drosera Operator will consume. We recommend starting with the above requirements and scaling up as needed.
